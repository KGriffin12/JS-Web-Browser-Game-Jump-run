# Jump-Run
> Jump-Run is an extremely basic web browser game. This game was created for a milestone project. The inspiration for this game came from a game I used to play on my IPod as a kid called Red Ball. Although Jump-Run is not as intricate the simplicity of the game brings back nostalgic memories.

## General Information
- Playing Jump-Run is as simple as pressing a button, quite litterally. The page will load then as you start to see the obstacles moving you press the up arrow key to jump over the obstacle. Once you hit the obstacle the game is over. There is no win or lose to this game, the objective is to get a high score each time you play.
- The purpose of my project is to have fun and play a simplistic game that does not require much brain power and can be played for as short or as long as you would like. 
- This Web Browser game was created as a milestone project for a continuing education coding bootcamp.
